## Creating a Personal SaaS

---

### User Story

**As a client**,  
I, Pedro, want to create a SaaS that allows me to better control my expenses and debts.

To achieve this, I decided to design an architecture for a basic SaaS that supports:
- Creating expenses (expense registration)
- Querying expenses within a specific time range

The main objective is to clearly understand where my money is going and to gain better control over my personal finances.
